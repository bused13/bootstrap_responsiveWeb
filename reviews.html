                    <p>My husband and I were very impresses with this tour and the one we took in Madrid. The guides 
                        were very knowledgeable and friendly. Both tours were well organized and the fee was very reasonable. 
                        I will definitely use them again and tell all my friends to use them for their tours.

                        The  trip down the grand canal was fantastic with the sun setting towards the end of the journey. 
                        Definitely money well spent.We could do it all again tomorrow.</p>

                        <p>Great local (english-speaking) tour guides who really know the city's history and architecture. 
                            Very informative and enjoyable. St. Marks Basilica tour was very short, as only the 
                            central cathedral was visited. If you expect a more detailed tour of St. Mark's, I suggest you 
                            find a different tour. However, as a overall tour of Venice, especially for 1st time visitors, Venice in One Day tour, both walking and grand canal boat tour, is a great 
                            value and truly helps you understand the history and special culture of Venice.</p>

                    <p>We decided on this company after on a friendâ€™s recommendation. We loved every minute if our Venice holiday and the walking tour guide was excellent. We would suggest taking water even in October and remember to take sensible walking shoes. The trip on the canal was breathtaking. Lots of photo opportunities. The breaks allowed us to peruse the shops and sample the amazing food on offer.</p>

                <p>My parents and I enjoyed all our tours. The walking tour was very informative and we would never 
                    have had enough time to venture back into some of the small canals without a guide 
                    This tour gave us the opportunity to see so much more than we would have on our own! 
                    During our breaks we had plenty of time for lunch & some shopping. 
                    The boat tour was on a beautiful wood water taxi and our guide was very friendly and informative as well. I will recommend this tour to all my friends and family!</p>
